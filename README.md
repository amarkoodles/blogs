Docker installed on your local machine
1. Pull the Zipkin Docker image:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to pull the Zipkin Docker image:

docker pull openzipkin/zipkin

2. Run Zipkin container:
Once the image is pulled, execute the following command to run Zipkin as a Docker container:
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 --name zipkin-container openzipkin/zipkin

This command does the following:

-d: Runs the container in detached mode.
-p 9411:9411: Maps port 9411 of the container to port 9411 on your local machine. This is the default port used by Zipkin for the web interface.
--name zipkin-container: Assigns a name (zipkin-container) to the running container.


3. Access Zipkin UI:
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:9411 (assuming you haven't changed the port mapping). This will take you to the Zipkin UI, where you can view and analyze the traces collected from your Spring Boot application.

4. Integrate Spring Boot application with Zipkin:
Make sure your Spring Boot application is configured to send traces to the Zipkin server by setting the spring.zipkin.base-url property in your application properties or YAML file, as mentioned in the previous instructions.

With these steps completed, your Spring Boot application should start sending traces to the Zipkin server running in the Docker container. You can then use the Zipkin UI to visualize and analyze the distributed traces generated by your application.
